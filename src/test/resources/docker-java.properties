# Docker Engine 29+ (shipped with Docker Desktop 4.52+) requires a minimum
# client API version of 1.44.  The docker-java library bundled with
# Testcontainers 1.20.x defaults to API version 1.32, which Docker rejects
# with a 400 Bad Request.
#
# This property overrides the negotiated API version so the client speaks
# a dialect the daemon accepts.
#
# See: https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-java/issues/11212
api.version=1.44
